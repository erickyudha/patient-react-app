# Patient React App

This repository contains a simple React application built with Vite that allows you to manage patient room data. This app does not use a database; it is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Installation

Before you can run the Patient React App, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you don't have them already, you can download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-react-app.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or the URL of your forked repository.

2. Change your current directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd patient-react-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, you can start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The application should now be running locally. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Patient React App.

## Usage

The Patient React App allows you to:

- View a list of patients and their room information.
- Add new patients with their room details.
- Delete patients from the list.

Please note that this app does not persist data since it does not use a database. All data is stored in memory and will be reset when you refresh the page or restart the server.

# Prototyping

We used Figma to create a design prototype for the website. Access [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AJlMtwZZ56XsFJqfiDUeEF/Prototype-PPL?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hC21gvVeAzaFAqpW-1) for the prototype.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
